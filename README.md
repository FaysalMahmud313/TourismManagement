CASE STUDY:

This project implements a Tourism Management System designed to streamline and digitalize tourism related operations. The system supports three types of users Admin, Vendor, and Traveler. An Admin can perform CRUD operations on user accounts and manage system access. A Vendor is responsible for handling resources such as hotels, flights with the ability to add, update, and remove entries from the database. A Traveler can browse and view available services, make bookings for hotels or flights, and confirm reservations When a booking is completed, the system generates a bill and stores it in the database and send invoices to user emails. It also updates the availability of rooms, flights, or packages to ensure accurate records. The system supports secure payment options such as bank and mobile banking for travelers to finalize their reservations. In addition, users can submit reviews and feedback on their travel experiences, which helps improve service quality. This project ensures efficient management of tourism activities, improves user convenience, and maintains accurate, up-to-date records of all transactions and services.
